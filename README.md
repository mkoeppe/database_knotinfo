# Database KnotInfo

This repository contains the complete content of the [KnotInfo](https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu/) and [LinkInfo](https://linkinfo.sitehost.iu.edu/)  databases in `CSV` format (converted from the corresponding Excel spreadsheets).

It has been created as a part of the SageMath interface to theses databases (see [#30352](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30352)  but can also be used independently.

The `CSV` files can be upgraded with the `create_knotinfo_csv.py` script.
